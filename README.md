# SPA Multiplayer RPS Game

In this project, we were tasked with creating a multiplayer game as a single page application (SPA) using React in the frontend, ASP.NET and signalR in the backend. The data was stored in an SQL database using Entity Framework.
We used an open source bootstrap theme for the design (https://bootswatch.com/Quartz/).

## How to run:
* Add your own connection string in app.settings
* update the DB using the database-update command
* Run the application
* Register an account, password needs to be 6 characters long (with special character, capital & small letter and a number).
* Log in to account and navigate to "Game Lobby" under the "rock papre scissors" tab.
* Create a game, and then join. (need 2 accounts on different browsers to play)
* Page needs to be reloaded to start the game.
